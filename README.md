# Fall Detection and Alert System
Fall is an event that can prove to be highly dangerous
for the elderly, and it can even be fatal if not addressed
immediately. The risk of falling is especially high among
populations with balance issues, such as the elderly,
amputees, and those suffering from neurological diseases.
Alzheimer's disease patients are three times more prone to
falling. Indeed, due to age-related biological changes, falls
increase exponentially, resulting in a high frequency of falls
and fall-related injuries among the elderly

As a solution to the problem described above, we've concentrated on building a reliable fall detection and alarm
system, as a handheld device, that can aid in detecting falls and informing family
members or the nearest healthcare practitioner for help and
support as a solution to the problem outlined above.
